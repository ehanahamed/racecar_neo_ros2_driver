#!/bin/bash
# setup_networking.sh — configure eth0 dual-IP and an isolated AP on the ALFA
# dongle for racecar.
#
# This script:
#   1. Installs a NetworkManager dispatcher that blocks FORWARD on the AP
#      interface so AP clients can reach the Pi's services (dashboard, jupyter,
#      SSH) but cannot use the Pi as an internet gateway.
#   2. Creates the racecar AP NetworkManager connection on the AP interface
#      (WPA2 / 2.4 GHz / channel 6 / 10.42.0.1/24). The AP interface is the ALFA
#      MT7612U dongle, pinned to wlan1 by the 99-racecar.rules udev rule.
#   3. Writes /etc/netplan/99-racecar-eth0.yaml so eth0 carries both a static
#      address (default 192.168.52.200/24) and a DHCP-assigned address, then
#      runs `netplan apply`.
#   4. Resets the Pi's built-in wlan0 to default (client) mode, removing any AP
#      connection a pre-v0.7.0 setup left bound to it.
#
# WARNING: this script reconfigures the AP interface. If you're SSH'd in over
# the AP, the connection will drop when the AP cycles. Run from a wired (eth0)
# session or directly on the console.
#
# Parameters (override via environment variables before running):
#   RACECAR_AP_IFACE      (default: wlan1 — the ALFA dongle)
#   RACECAR_AP_SSID       (default: racecar-neo-1)
#   RACECAR_AP_PSK        (default: racecar@mit)
#   RACECAR_AP_CHANNEL    (default: 6)
#   RACECAR_AP_ADDR       (default: 10.42.0.1/24)
#   RACECAR_ETH_STATIC    (default: 192.168.52.200/24)
#
# All steps are idempotent — re-running is safe.
